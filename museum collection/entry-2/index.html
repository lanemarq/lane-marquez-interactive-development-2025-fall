        <p>1.</p>

        <p>In a way I (wonder which color I should get),<br>
        Hope that (I won’t regret this) I can find peace in my breathing impulsivity,<br>
        Carried by the subtlety of my (foolish), trembling self, and the reflection that looks at me (Hi there!),<br>
        I can be more than what people say I am (a girl).</p>

        <p>The cheapest dye and bleach (how dumb of me, whoops) that my sprouting soul could buy,<br>
        With money (I barely even had, mind you), carrying promises and expectations from,<br>
        Who knows where (I knew, really), but I can learn the map from the way of the paper,<br>
        Filled with lines of how to not burn my scalp and hair off (and how not to piss off my parents).</p>

        <p>When the bleach falls on my hair for the first time,<br>
        And the blue takes away my blonde, with the shower changing along with my hair<br>
        The blue stains never fully came out, now being, the evidence of,<br>
        My presence in these odd, high school, dorms.</p>

        <p>The ends, left dead and brittle through cheap bleach and dye,<br>
        I swore to myself to never again do it, it's too damaging, too much for my hair,<br>
        I’ll never do it again, it just washed out too quickly, too oddly,<br>
        Maybe it just wasn’t for me.</p>
      </div>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <div class="card-title" style="background:#ce0909;">Red</div>
      <div class="card-mask"></div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>2.</p>

        <p>And when I looked at myself in the mirror and saw the evidence of my reflection,<br>
        The longest part of my fresh, alive, wolf cut, that bright, vivid, alive red<br>
        I was nothing more than the feeling of an external force,<br>
        Of waving euphoria in my throat reaching the corners of my smiling mouth.</p>

        <p>(Turns out my real mistake was trusting splat bleach and hair dye that first time, haha.)<br>
        (I think the red in my hair fits me way better than the blue ever did, don’t you think?)<br>
        (Sally’s has this colored conditioner I could use to keep it vibrant. I should go there soon.)<br>
        (The only con is that it looks like a bloodbath whenever I wash my hair. Yiiiiikes.)</p>

        <p>It feels like, I just discovered the simple act of finding something more,<br>
        About the inner workings of the crevices engulfing my mind and body,<br>
        Finding more than, what I thought I only had,<br>
        It softens, the weight of that fragment.</p>

        <p>(The conditioner for my hair was ten whole dollars. In THIS economy?)<br>
        (Everytime it rains, I have to pray to whoever will listen to me so that my clothes don’t turn red.)<br>
        (But it's soooo worth it though. Can you believe I just didn’t dye my hair for that long?)<br>
        (Though my friend called and told me they found a red strand of hair in their house, how did that happen?)</p>

        <p>It was the invitation my fingers felt that allowed me to figure this out more,<br>
        I can’t always stay the same after all, I morph and shape and grow older with time and water,<br>
        Oddly shaped brows and chokers, glasses I couldn’t use.<br>
        I feel that, I might slowly be figuring it out.</p>

    <article class="card">
      <div class="card-title" style="background:#ea8b38;">Orange</div>
      <div class="card-mask"></div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>3.</p>

        <p>(I went with orange so that it would be that color by Halloween.)<br>
        (And also because I didn’t want to just stop at red, that would be silly, I think.)<br>
        (There’s colors I haven’t tried. I want to try them all.)<br>
        (Other than like. Maybe yellow. I don’t know. Yellow is okay.)</p>

        <p>(The orange isn’t as vibrant as I would like, I wish I waited to bleach my hair more.)<br>
        (But black hair is so hard to bleach, it feels like I have to burn my hair off just to get it the way I want.)<br>
        (And then it feels so. Dry. Like the texture of hair those dolls had that my mama always tried to get me to play with.)<br>
        (Maybe I should get it bleached professionally, but that’s crazy expensive. I need to buy groceries this week.)</p>

        <p>Strands I can’t afford to lose,<br>
        To the ones, and twos, of colored water and the salt from my body,<br>
        I realize that, I could take control of it,<br>
        And the light flickers more.</p>

        <p>(My best friend cut my hair and dyed it whenever I was over at their parents’ house…)</p>

        <p>I always carry, the same things you gave in,<br>
        Scattered polaroids and breathing through teeth,<br>
        With the tattoo on my, left thigh,<br>
        I’ll carry you with me, too.</p>

        <p>(If you’re reading this, I miss you bestie. Let’s go get Taco Bell whenever you’re home.)</p>

      <div class="card-mask"></div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>5.</p>

        <p>(This is my current hair color, I really like it a lot, though I really should redye it before Friday.)</p>

        <p>All of my pulsing, gripped droplets of sweat and countless repressed cries I wanted so badly to,</p>

        <p>(I’m so tired though.)</p>

        <p>Let out like the sound of my brake pads that I cannot afford to replace,</p>

        <p>(I would rather go to bed than spend time redyeing my hair.)</p>

        <p>I’ll see, the efforts of my work in a vivid vision I glance at through my faded, swollen corners,</p>

        <p>(Maybe, life isn’t all about working. Maybe it's just about living and enjoying it. Isn’t that crazy?)</p>

        <p style="color: #ce0909;">And feel that same flicker of the match finally, set me free.</p>
