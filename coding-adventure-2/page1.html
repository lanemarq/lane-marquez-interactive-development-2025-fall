            <p>You start to recall...you are a little snake roaming through the woods on a path you've never been on before. You feel like you've been slithering down this path for a good while, but your curiosity of a place one of your snake friends recommended you a few days ago keeps you from giving up. You will make it to this mysterious bar place. Or was it just a drink place? Whatever it is.
