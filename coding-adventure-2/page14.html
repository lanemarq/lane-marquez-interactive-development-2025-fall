I was just drinking some before I went to a gas station I used to go to as a kid and steal their gas station hot dogs. I got banned from there a while ago. Because I once fought a lady for those hot dogs. But I have never had one that are as good as those. I'm trying to drink to ease the nerves a little." </p>
