║ You are awake, although annoyed that you couldn’t sleep more.       ║
║  You take note that your human caretakers are out of the house      ║
║  and that the sun is going down outside. The cold air of the house  ║
║  hits you. You feel like going outside (at least you think so       ║
║ anyway).                                                            ║
